# libft

Libft is a library of useful functions written in C, designed to help you write your own programs more quickly and efficiently

It includes implementations of common functions like strlen, strcpy, memset, and atoi, as well as some more specialized functions like linked list manipulation and string formatting

## Installation

To use libft in your own projects, simply clone the repository and compile it with the Makefile provided:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spookier/libft.git
cd libft
make
```

This will generate a static library called libft.a that you can link to your own programs.


## Usage

To use libft in your own programs, include the appropriate header files and link to the libft.a library:

```c
#include "libft.h"

int main(void)
{
    char *str = "Hello, world!";
    ft_putstr(str);
    return 0;
}
```
This program uses the ft_putstr function from libft to print a string to the console

To compile your project with libft, add -L /path/to/libft -lft to your compiler flags
